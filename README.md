# DRAMA

Exploration of ways to incorporate emotions/drama into AI NPCs or humanoid robots.

## General TODO Directions

- Accept that python is probably the way forward for the beginning of this
- Get familiar with Alpaca/LLaMA. Does it do well in chat situations? Can it handle weird inputs from humans? Is there memory? How does that work? What would be needed to add memory?
- Is it possible to sample Alpaca into another model, perhaps one that also holds emotional tags or states?
- See if Alpaca can understand who it is talking to? What would the memory need to contain?
- Can Alpaca reason from different emotional states?
- Get familiar with Whisper. Does it run locally? How fast is it? Can it listen well? Does it understand who is talking? Can it handle multiple voices?
