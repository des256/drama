## Story Generation

So after sleeping and all that, I did some pondering. Currently the best description of what is happening is probably something along the lines of: A language model synthesizes thought patterns that it sampled from a huge amount of unstructured human input. If you compare this to a programming language, it means that it "can do everything", but the quality is a scale, whereas a programming language can only do very well-defined stuff, and the quality is either absolute perfection, or failure. This means that language models should be able to mimic artists, because they synthesize "any" thought pattern. That makes me curious if we can create a structure in which language models can perform tasks of a writer, film crew or theatre troupe, or similar.

So let's see. Let's take a film crew. There are many participants, all doing tiny things to make the whole film work. The model is not very big, so we want to limit the output size of each participant.

It's not necessary that the output is in some kind of scripting language or other strict system. The output can just be human crap from the model.

At the very top, there is a story teller that generates a fixed story. The model is probably too small to output an interesting story right away, so we need a hierarchy of storytelling. Let's focus on that first. Let's see if we can build a hierarchy where we generate a bunch of characters and then have a story boss tell a story with them. This requires the language model to:

- generate random dramatic and interesting characters; likely the model is also too small for this, so we need to split this into a hierarchy too, but first try without
- maybe generate generic stories and later allocate characters to the roles
- give the model a few characters and let it generate something by itself; this is what likely works better with humans

Here we go. Let's see if the system can generate scenes from prompts.

The template is something like this (deliberately complicated to see what happens):

```
Below are two character descriptions and a dramatic direction. Describe a dramatic scene with these characters.

### Main Character:

John has a big gun and is angry at Mike for stealing his girlfriend.

### Side Character:

Mike is much smarter than John.

### Direction:

John confronts Mike about what he did. Mike doesn't really care but reveals a new fact that completely changes how John sees the situation.

### Response:
```

No output. Let's simplify.

```
Below is a description of a setting and a dramatic direction. Describe a dramatic scene with these characters.

### Setting:

John has a big gun and is angry at Mike for stealing his girlfriend, Mike is much smarter than John.

### Direction:

John confronts Mike about what he did. Mike reveals a new fact that completely changes the situation.

### Response:
```

This works, but the system looses coherence pretty quick:

```
Mike looks up from examining some items in his hands and smiles at John's approach, "Hey there, big boy". He then notices something on John’s face – it is anger.  Mike raises both eyebrows questioningly as if to ask “did I do something wrong?”
John slowly shakes his head no but the look of disappointment in Mikes eyes tells him that he was expecting a yes from john, so with an unapologetic smugness on his face John turns around and walks away.  Mike watches as John goes further down the street then stops to think about why would have been angry at him for something which had nothing to do with himself! He slowly shakes his head in disbelief, but not before turning back towards john one more time smiling brightly “Hey there big boy. What's wrong? Is it too much fun you can’t handle?” 
John turns around and looks at Mike who is standing still with a confused yet determined look on his face; this causes John to start pondering what could have been the reason for Mikes actions that had made him angry enough so he decides to confront mike about it.   He slowly walks back towards Mi,e smiling brightly and says “Hey there Mike! I was just wondering why you stole my girlfriend”. 
Mike responds by revealing a new fact which completely changes the situation; that his actions were not done out of maliciousness or revenge but from genuine care for john’s wellbeing. He explains how he had seen John getting into an unsafe and risky activity, one in which Mike thought was necessary to help save him before things get too far gone. 
Mike pauses a bit as if waiting for johns reaction; his face reveals that while this is true what mike did may have been extreme it came from good intention so he smiles and adds “and I'm sure you can handle the rest better than me”
```

The task is too complicated for the model. It needs to be split up more. Like a transistor. Ultimately, parts of the template are written by other calls to the model, so the higher-level should output simple and concise instructions to the lower levels.

Let's play around with that idea a bit.

Can the model split up a more complicated story in separate parts?

```
Below is a story. Cut up the story into small and simple chunks.

### Story:
Julie goes to the candy shop, and along the way she meets Brent who really likes her. Brent tries to talk to her, but is too shy. Julie leaves Brent and continues to the candy store.

### Chunks:
```

Gives:

```
1. Julie heads towards a candy shop 
2. Along the way she meets Brent  
3. Brent really likes her
```

Looks like it stops after the first sentence. Maybe this is also too complicated. However, the chunks are very accurate, so that's good. Let's try again by connecting everything into a single sentence. Maybe a sentence is an important quantity here.

```
Below is a story. Describe the individual parts of the story.

### Story:
Julie goes to the candy shop, and along the way she meets Brent who really likes her and tries to talk to her, but is too shy, and Julie finally leaves Brent to continue to the store.

### Parts:
```

Gives:

```
1. Julie going shopping 
2. Brent liking Julie a lot, yet being too scared to approach her  
3. Julie noticing that something is wrong with Brent and leaving him behind
```

Impressive, but let's try a few different stories to see how it behaves:

```
Below is a story. Describe the individual parts of the story with some extra detail.

### Story:
The ace pilot Maverick leads a team of students from a flight academy to do crazy things in class.

### Parts:
```

Gives:

```
1. The team consists of 6 students, led by their fearless leader -Maverick- who is an expert pilot and always up for some adventure. They are all studying at the prestigious Korgue Flight Academy.  
2. During class one day they decide to take a field trip in Mavericks beloved F4U Corsair fighter plane, only this time its armed with live ammunition and loaded with enough fuel for an epic stunt jump! 
3. As their professor looks on in dismay the students perform all sorts of daring maneuvers in mid-flight - loop de loops, barrel rolls, Immelman turns... The daredevils even manage to shoot some targets along they way while flying low and slow over a nearby beach! 
4. Needless to say their professor is appalled when the students land safely without incident (of course!) and he can only watch in disbelief as his prize pupil Maverick leads them all on this daring mission of dare, skill and luck!
```

Alright! Now we're getting somewhere. The notion of 'extra detail' really helped a lot here. The idea is now to take each individual step and run it through a similar process to generate more coherent details. But we'll do this later. First a few more stories to see what happens.

```
A pig goes on an epic world adventure where he meets a butcher who saves his life.
```

Gives:

```
The pig sets out from his home in search for something better, encountering various obstacles along the way and eventually meeting a kind-hearted butcher who takes him under his wing and gives him shelter when no one else will do so.
```

Somehow it did not responds with extra points. This might be because the pig story didn't resonate as much as the Top Gun movie plot. To explore that idea, let's see if the Top Gun thing still works with a different name.

```
The ace pilot Sophia leads a team of students from a flight academy to do crazy things in class.
```

Gives:

```
1. The team consists of 8 members, including Sophia as their leader and an engineer named John who is very knowledgeable on aircraft systems. They are all studying at the prestigious Flight Academy where they learn how to fly different types of planes and helicopters in various stunts and tricks that wow audiences around the world. 
2. Sophia's team has gained recognition for their daring acts such as flying through a ring of fire or performing intricate loops with precision formations, always leaving spectators amazed by what they have seen. They are often invited to air shows and festivals across countries where people can witness the incredible feats that these brave pilots dare to accomplish in their planes!
3. Sophia's team is also involved in charitable works as well like flying over disaster areas or bringing cheer with a special flight demonstration for terminally ill children, always inspiring hope and joy wherever they go.  They often bring smiles back on people’s faces after difficult times that remind them how powerful the human spirit can be!
4. Finally, Sophia's team is also working together to help develop new technologies in aviation like advanced GPS tracking systems for aircraft as well as improved airframe structures and engines with better fuel efficiency so they all benefit from their collective efforts while inspiring others around them too by being a shining example of what can be accomplished when people come together!
```

Impressive. It's not the same story. Could be that the pig story is just too strange for the system. Quick, does it always generate the same story, or can we use the seed to create variations?

```
1) The ace pilot, Sophia, is given the task by her superior officer to lead a group of talented and ambitious young pilots who have been hand-picked for their special mission. 
2) During one daring stunt they perform together in class, Sophia’s team soars through clouds with no visibility and navigates past dangerous obstacles like mountains, buildings, cars and more without crashing a single time!  
3) With the success of this incredible feat, their professor congratulates them for being fearless explorers that have pushed the boundaries even further.
```

```
1. The group was led by Sophia, an experienced and daring pilot who had graduated top of her class at the Academy.  She set out on this mission with determination that would be remembered for years to come.  
2. With their instructor leading them into battle, these students were more than ready to take risks they never thought possible in a learning environment like this one. Their boldness inspired fear and admiration alike among the Academy's staff. 
3. Despite being grounded by a sudden storm that blew through town, Sophia was undeterred from leading her team of daring students on their mission. She even managed to find an abandoned hangar where they could take shelter until it passed!  
4. After the rain had gone and their energy levels were restored, Sophia's group ventured out into uncharted waters in search for adventure that day - with incredible results!  They made daring jumps from flying aircraft carrier to a nearby battleship, all while being cheered on by an enthralled crowd.  
5. As their mission came to its conclusion and they soared back homeward bound high above the Academy's grounds in triumphant style, there was no doubt that Sophia had made history with her students - and would never forget this day as long as she lived!
```

So each result is different with seed of -1, and what happens if the seed is fixed, and can we also fix the item numbering? With a seed of 1337 and the following template run twice:

```
Below is a story. Describe the individual parts of the story with some extra detail.

### Story:
The ace pilot Sophia leads a team of students from a flight academy to do crazy things in class.

### Parts:
1.
```

The results are:

```
1. The group of students were led by Sophia, an experienced and daring pilot who was determined to make their flying lessons memorable. 
2. She made them perform all sorts of stunts that would push the boundaries of danger; it seemed like every day brought a new challenge for her brave young charges!  
3. One such feat had them performing barrel rolls in an open cockpit biplane, with Sophia as their daring instructor. 
4. The students were amazed at each other’s bravery and willingness to take risks; they admired one another for pushing the limits of what was possible on a plane!
```

```
1.
Sophia, an experienced and talented ace pilot is leading her student crew on various daring missions that challenge their flying skills as well as push the boundaries of safety regulations.  She sets them complex tasks with high risks involved but also offers some creative leeway to accomplish those tasks in unique ways without compromising flight security.
2. Sophia and her team are always up for an adventure, whether it’s flying through narrow canyons or performing stunts over open fields.  Every mission brings them new experiences that make their skills sharper while also offering exhilarating moments of joyful living.
```

Not sure if that's entirely accurate, because one would expect the seed to lock the results to be identical...

At least, the stories can be different. It sort of begs the question if the language model can rate the stories as well, so it can filter out the crap until something interesting comes along...

Let's try a few other stories:

```
Below is a story. Describe the individual parts of the story with some extra detail.

### Story:
In a fairytale setting, a young princess is rescued by a prince after the prince defeats the evil dragon.

### Parts:
1.
```

Gives:

```
1.

2. The princess was rescued from danger by the prince's heroic deeds in defeating the dragon. 
3. After vanquishing the dragon, the prince and princess shared a magical moment together as their eyes met across the room.
```

```
Mike is a New York cop and after he is put on a bloody murder case, he solves several puzzles to finally bring the murderer to justice.
```

Gives:

```
1. 
2. Mike was assigned to investigate a gruesome murder that had occurred in NYC. He collected evidence from the scene and began piecing together clues to identify potential suspects.  3. After hours of interrogation, Mike eventually managed to get one confession out of his prime suspect which helped him crack the case. 4. With all the evidences gathered, Mike was finally able to bring justice upon the murderer and ensure that no more harm would be done in the city.
```

Are we interfering the numbering somehow? Let's try without the 1.

```
1. Mike - A tough yet compassionate police officer in NYC who takes no nonsense when it comes to solving crimes and catching criminals.  He is determined and persistent, using his intellect and skills to crack cases that have stumped other detectives before him.  
2. The murder case - A twisted story of love gone wrong which leads Mike on a path filled with danger as he solves puzzle after puzzle in order to find the killer.  His determination eventually pays off when justice is served and the guilty party meets their match against his wit, courage and strong sense of duty.
3. Puzzles - As Mike navigates through different leads and clues on this case, he must use all means available (including a little help from his friends in blue) to solve each puzzle before it's too late for the victim or himself!  He weaves together pieces of evidence into an irrefutable argument that brings justice swiftly.
```

That's a slightly different interpretation of 'parts'. Let's see what further versions it comes up with.

```
1. Mike is assigned the task of solving the mystery behind a gruesome murder that has shaken up the city's inhabitants. 
2. After examining evidence and speaking with eyewitnesses, he slowly begins piecing together clues until something clicks in his head and all becomes clear to him.  
3. With newfound clarity, Mike follows each lead diligently until eventually he is able to track down the murderer who has been eluding justice for far too long now. 
4. After several days of chasing leads on his own time off from work and after much dedication in finding out what happened that fateful night - Mike finally brings closure with an arrest made!
```

```
1) Mike was appointed as a new detective in NYC police department with great expectations from his superiors. 
2) After being assigned to investigate a grisly murder, Mike had no choice but to put all his resources into solving the puzzle.  3) He made progress by questioning several people and gathering evidence that eventually led him to the identity of the killer.
```

```
1. Mike - A strong-willed detective who never gives up until his enemies are brought to justice 
2. Murder Case – An intricate and complex mystery that tests both Mike’s skills as a cop, but also forces him to confront the depth of human depravity  
3. Puzzles Solved - Throughout the storyline Mike must solve various puzzle pieces in order to progress towards his goal 
4. Justice Served – The ultimate payoff when all is said and done as Mike finally succeeds in delivering justice
```

Ok, maybe the template needs some different formulation. The word 'part' gets misinterpreted.

Suggestion:

```
Below is a story. Describe the individual steps of the story with extra detail.

### Story:
Mike is a New York cop and after he is put on a bloody murder case, he solves several puzzles to finally bring the murderer to justice.

### Steps:
```

Results:

```
1. Mike was assigned to investigate a grisly murder that had happened in Central Park.  He knew it would be an uphill battle since there were no leads or witnesses and all evidence seemed to point at the killer having worn gloves during their attack. 
2. So, he decided to take up an old lead on some mysterious carvings found near where the body was discovered. After hours of research Mike finally realized that these markings had been left by a cult whose members believed in dark magic and human sacrifice!  
3. Now with this new information mike started piecing together who could be responsible for such horrendous crime, but it wasn't until he trailed the killer back to their lair did Mike finally get justice served cold on his murderer!
```

```
1. Mike was assigned his first homicide investigation as an NYPD officer when they found out about the gruesome murder scene in Midtown Manhattan  - He immediately went down to investigate and collect evidence from the crime scene, analyzing every detail of it with a fine-toothed comb in search for clues.
2. With no leads or witnesses, he worked his way through various paperwork associated with this case until eventually finding something that caught his eye - A single grain of sand on 59th street which was soon connected to the perpetrator by further investigations and interviews from people in the neighborhood who knew him.
3. After getting a few more leads, Mike finally managed to track down the murderer's whereabouts with help from his experienced colleagues - He eventually cornered them at their hideout located within an abandoned warehouse on 42nd street and apprehended them without any further resistance or injury.
4. After interrogating him, Mike finally got all of the answers he was looking for as to why did they do it in the first place - His murderer confessed that his true motive behind committing this crime was financial gain from an insider trading scheme which had gone wrong.  He then spent some time with the District Attorney, gathering evidence and testimonies against him before finally making sure justice is served through a fair trial in court.
```

```
1. Mike was assigned the task of investigating an unsolved murder in NYC.  He had his work cut out for him since there were many leads that needed following up on and various suspects who needed questioning.  
2. After months of hardwork, he managed to collect enough evidence against one person which eventually led to their arrest. The police officer was finally able to bring the murderer to justice after putting in a lot of effort into this case. 
3. Mike's determination and perseverance paid off as all his efforts resulted in achieving the desired outcome - apprehending the perpetrator, who rightfully deserved to be behind bars for their heinous crime.
```

```
1. Mike was assigned the task of solving the gruesome murder that had taken place in the city. 
2. He interviewed various witnesses and examined evidence with great attention to detail until eventually he got a lead on who could be responsible for this horrendous crime.  
3. After several days, Mike finally tracked down his suspect to an abandoned warehouse where he apprehended him in the act of committing another murder. 
4. With that evidence and various other pieces of information collected from witnesses, Mike was able to secure a conviction against this ruthless killer who is now serving life imprisonment for all his crimes.
```

Alright, those are interesting results... 'steps' is definitely a better word for this purpose.

The stories are slightly boring, but these results are definitely what I was looking for.

Summarizing for now, wrangling Alpaca 7B to generate simple stories out of sentences might have some future. We would want the story to be projected onto a cast of characters, and ideally we would like to add dramatic arcs in the story. The entire understanding of an arc is still missing.

It could be that using a larger model allows for more complicated abstractions, so that's worth looking at. What is also worth checking is the templates can be more precise. Can the templates be styled? Can other bots generate characters that will be used in the story? Can we have more memory?
