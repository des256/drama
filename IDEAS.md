## General

- Accept that python is probably the way forward for the beginning of this
- Get familiar with Alpaca/LLaMA. Does it do well in chat situations? Can it handle weird inputs from humans? Is there memory? How does that work? What would be needed to add memory?
- Is it possible to sample Alpaca into another model, perhaps one that also holds emotional tags or states?
- See if Alpaca can understand who it is talking to? What would the memory need to contain?
- Can Alpaca reason from different emotional states?
- Get familiar with Whisper. Does it run locally? How fast is it? Can it listen well? Does it understand who is talking? Can it handle multiple voices?

## Story Telling and Movie Making

- Is it possible to design a hierarchy of Alpaca bots to generate somewhat compelling dramatic arcs?
- Is it possible to design bots that create characters? Stage/decor? Flow?
- Is there some post-processing possible at each stage to rewrite the text into something more suitable?
- Where does the data need to be converted to non-human scripts and other resources?
